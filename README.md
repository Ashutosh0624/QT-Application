In Qt, the Signals and Slots mechanism is a core concept used to enable communication between objects. It is central to event-driven programming and helps to decouple components of your application, making it more modular and easier to manage.

Signals and Slots Overview
Signal: A signal is emitted when a particular event or state occurs. It does not need to know which function will handle it. It’s like a broadcast that something has happened.

Slot: A slot is a function that is called in response to a specific signal. It listens for the signal and reacts accordingly. Slots are typically member functions of objects.

How Signals and Slots Work
The Signal-Slot mechanism is implemented using Qt's meta-object system, which is based on reflection. It allows objects to send messages (signals) and other objects to receive those messages (slots) in a type-safe manner.

Signal: When an object’s state changes, a signal is emitted.
Slot: Another object can connect to the signal and call a function when the signal is emitted. This is done by connecting the signal to the slot.
